# Flyweight Airtable2Swagger
[![Tests](https://github.com/flyweightcloud/airtable2swagger/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/flyweightcloud/airtable2swagger/actions/workflows/test.yml)

A tool for taking building Swagger 2.0 files from a single Airtable api query

## Why

There's no easy way to start using Airtable from Microsofts ecosystem (PowerApps / Flow)

This seeks to resolve that issue

## Coming soon

This is still in beta, but quickly closing on a useable library/CLI

## Testing

```
npm ci
npm test
```
